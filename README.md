How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

To interpret user needs, I start by trying to understand what problems the user actually wants solved instead of just jumping straight into coding and development. Creating user stories helps break big ideas into small, realistic goals that directly connect back to what the user values most. It gives me a clear direction for what to build and how the finished product should look when it's finished. It also keeps development user-centered instead of just focusing on the finish line. 


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

I have actually learned a whole lot from the Agile principles and practices. For future development projects, I plan to incorporate some principles like sprints and personal sprint reviews with myself, even if I’m doing a solo project. This way I can identify blockers and bugs early, track my progress more clearly, and find areas where I can improve. I have realized that even as an individual developer, treating my work like a mini-Agile team keeps me organized and accountable. It also helps me stay focused on finishing my projects instead of constantly getting stuck and working out bugs. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly, staying dependable, and supporting other members when they need help. It's about being someone your team can count on to deliver quality work and follow through on commitments. I have learned that clear and honest communication can prevent a ton of problems before they happen, especially when deadlines are short or priorities shift. Helping others when they hit a roadblock doesn’t just make the project stronger, it also builds trust and keeps everyone moving in the same direction. A good teammate doesn’t just focus on their own tasks, but also pays attention to how their work impacts the whole project. This makes sure the team succeeds together instead of individually.
